# if they are qaulify to attend the job fair. Your function should 
# take the user's age and GPA in as parameters. If the user
# is above 17 and has atleast a 90 or above GPA they can go to the
# job fair. Otherwise they are not permitted to go.

# 2. Create a function that checks the price of an item, and depending 
# on the item they will get a specific discount amount. Your function
# should take in the item price as an input from the user. If the user's
# item costs between 50 and 75 dollars, they will get a 15% discount.
# If the item is above 75 dollars, they will recieve a 25% discount.
# Your program should print out and inform the user how much of a
